# PUBLIC_INTERFACE
# CRA development server configuration to avoid "Invalid host header" errors in containerized/preview environments.

# Preferred: set HOST to the exact domain used by the preview (without protocol).
# Example:
# HOST=vscode-internal-41321-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai

# Optional: Set PUBLIC_URL to ensure scripts are injected with the correct public path.
# Include protocol if needed. Example:
# PUBLIC_URL=https://vscode-internal-41321-beta.beta01.cloud.kavia.ai:3000

# Fallback (less secure): to completely disable host checks in dev.
# Use only in trusted preview environments.
# DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true

# Backend URL for API calls if not using same-origin or CRA proxy.
# Example:
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
